Project Title: Spam Emails Detection Chrome Extension | Final Year Project

Overview:
As part of my final year at Parul University, I developed a **Spam Email Classification Chrome Extension** integrated with a custom-built API. This project aims to enhance email security by helping users identify and filter out spam messages directly from their browsers.

Key Features:

 Chrome Extension built with a clean and intuitive UI
 Real-time spam detection using a trained Machine Learning model
 Seamless integration with Gmail via browser DOM parsing
Backend API built with Flask (Python) to process and classify emails
ML Model trained on a large dataset of labeled emails for high accuracy
 Focus on user privacy and data security

Tools & Technologies:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Python, Flask
* Scikit-learn, Pandas
* Chrome Extension APIs
* Git & GitHub for version control

Outcome:
Successfully deployed and tested the extension in a real-world environment, demonstrating effective spam classification with minimal false positives.

 This project showcases my skills in web development, machine learning, API integration, and browser extension development. It combines frontâ€”end and back-end expertise to solve a real-world problem.
